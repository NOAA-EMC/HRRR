The Minimization Monitor (MinMon) provides a means to regularly
track and report the peformance of the GSI minimization function.
It can be configured to send automated warnings to report irregular
events, such as resets, premature halts, and abnormally large, 
final results.

The MinMon routinely plots the operational GFS results for both
runs (gfs,gdas).  See http://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/gmb/gdas/index.html
and click on the "GSI Minimization Stats" in the left-most 
column at bottom (you may need to scroll down to see it).

##  Note to self:  need to add automatic set-up of the LOGdir ##
##  to the install script.				      ##

To set up the MinMon with an experimental parallel, first run the
MinMon_install.pl script (in the same directory as this README file).
That will configure your copy of the MinMon for your local use.  You 
will need to designate the location of your TANKdir, or extracted
data repository.  Normally this will be space in a noscrub area.

When you have produced gsistat files from your experimental run
use the [MinMon_package_location]/data_xtrc/ush/MinMon_DE.sh script
to perform the necessay data extraction on the gsistat file(s).  The
default values within the MinMon_DE.sh and subsequent scripts are
configured to process gsistat files from the operational GFS/gfs or 
GFS/gdas.  You will need to override values such as the location of
your gsistat files in order to run the MinMon.  You can do this in
your shell or (recommended) you may adapt one of the 
run_[gdas|gfs|fv3rt1]_DE.sh scripts to your use.  

The MinMon_DE.sh script will produce output files in your $TANKdir
directory in the structure of suffix/$run.$pdy/$cyc/minmon/[data files].
Once you have data here you can run the 
[MinMon_package_location]/image_gen/html/[install script] to configure
a web site for your experiment.

The last step is to run the image generation script 
[MinMon_package_location]/image_gen/ush/MinMon_Plt.sh.  Here too there
are several plot_[gfs|gdas|fv3rt1]_IG.sh scripts which can be adapted
to override the default values used by MinMon_Plt.sh.
