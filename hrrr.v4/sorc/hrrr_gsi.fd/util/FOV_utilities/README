Run the GSI field of view code for conical and crosstrack intruments
in a 'stand-alone' mode.  Computes both FOV size/shape and 
relative antenna power.

HOW TO RUN:

1) Compile the driver program:  The program consists of a driver
(driver.f90) and links to the required GSI routines.  To compile,
go to ./sorc and type 'make'.  The intel Fortran compiler is assumed.
The executable name is "fov_util.exe"

2) Setup the run script:  The program is run by the "run_fov.ksh"
script located in ./scripts.  Perform the following changes inside
the run_fov.ksh script prior to running the script:

  a) Set $EXE_PATH and $EXE to the path and name of the program.
  b) Set $WORK to the working directory.
  c) Set the config.nml namelist variables.  These varaibles are:

         27 = F17 SSMIS
         28 = F18 SSMIS
         29 = F19 SSMIS
         30 = F20 SSMIS

     satid - Satellite id.  Valid choices are:
     --------------------
         - 'tirosn'
         - 'dmsp'
         - 'f13', 'f14', 'f15', 'f16', 'f17'
         - 'trmm'
         - 'aura'
         - 'aqua'
         - 'metop-a' 'metop-b', 'metop-c'
         - 'n05', 'n06', 'n07', 'n08', 'n09',
           'n10', 'n11', 'n12', 'n14', 'n15',
           'n16', 'n17', 'n18', 'n19'

     fov_num - Field of view number. Valid ranges are:
     -------
         All AVHRR: 1 thru 2048
         All HIRS:  1 thru 56
         SSU:       1 thru 8
         MSU:       1 thru 11
         MHS:       1 thru 13
         AMSU-A:    1 thru 30
         AMSU-B:    1 thru 90
         AIRS:      1 thru 90
         All ATMS:  1 thru 96
         IASI:      1 thru 120
         OTHERS:    NOT USED FOR CONICAL SENSORS.  SET TO -999

     sat_az  - satellite azimuth angle (degrees)
     ------
 
     lat_cent_fov - latitude of center of field of view (degrees)
     ------------
        Valid range is -88 to +88 degrees.
 
     lon_cent_fov - longitude of center of field of view (degrees)
     ------------

3) Run the program by invoking the script: type "run_fov.ksh"

4) Check the program output in the $WORK working directory.

   a) Program standard output is in "log"

   b) The FOV information is output to GRADS station files:

      The size/shape of the FOV may be viewed with:

        ellipse.dat  (data file)
        ellipse.map  (station map file)
        ellipse.ctl  (control file)

      The relative antenna power from within the FOV may be visualized with:
 
        power.dat  (data file)
        power.map  (station map file)
        power.ctl  (control file)
 
      For some sensors, the FOV size and/or the antenna power is channel specific:

        AMSUA - antenna power is channel specific (15 channels)
        MHS   - antenna power is channel specific (5 channels)
        SSMIS - FOV size and antenna power are channel specific (24 channels)
 
      Multiple channels are stored as mulitple 'time' levels.  For example,
      to view channel 3, do a "set t 3" during your GRADS session.
   
   c) A non-zero exit status indicates an error.  Errors codes are listed 
      in ./sorc/driver.f90.
