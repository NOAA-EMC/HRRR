Release Notes:  HRRR v2.0.0

v2.0.0 - released February 9, 2016
  now uses WRF Version 3.6
  uses updated version of GSI, and hybrid assimilation is introduced
  uses updated version of post processor code
  major scientific changes to address warm, dry bias present in HRRR version 1
  forecasts extended to 18 hours
  upgrade being made concurrently with RAPv3
  added capability to restart stalled forecast job
  output changes
  large number of new parameters in all output files
  sub-hourly output now sent to AWIPS
  all output now available to f18


compute resource information
   still runs every hour, but now to f18
   forecast job changes from 47 nodes (24 tasks/node)  to 93 nodes (24 tasks/node)
   makebc job changes from 4 nodes (24 tasks/node) to 7 nodes (24 tasks/node)
   makeguess job changes from 4 nodes (24 tasks/node) to 6 nodes (24 tasks/node)
   history file format changed from netcdf to parallel netcdf
   single cycle runtime seems to increase by a couple of minutes but WCOSS timings have been very inconsistent


disk space used per day increases approximately 30%
     o    Data retention for files in /com and /nwges under 
                     prod/para/test environments
     o    asking to maintain current retention of data in /com2 and  
                  /nwges in prod and recommend same retention for parallel.    
     o   asking to retain one extra day of /com2/nawips/prod/rap*


new executables
     o    hrrr_full_surface_cycle
     o    hrrr_process_enkf
     o    hrrr_process_imssnow
     o    hrrr_process_sst
  
   
new jobs
     o   JHRRR_PROCESS_ENKF (run for 00,06,12,18 EnKF cycles);  run as a separate job (just 
                 like makebc);  the jobs should be run at +7:15 after the cycle time - i.e.  the 12z EnKF 
                 processing  job should be run at 1915z;   a new directory /nwges/prod/rap/rapges_enkf must 
                 be created;  runs with 96 tasks at 24 tasks/node

     o   JHRRR_FORECAST_RESTART (run as needed to revive a stalled forecast - see 
                    instructions_restart in the hrrr_v2.0.0 directory)


pre-implementation testing requirements
  need to test RTMA/URMA upgrade concurrently
  need to test obsproc upgrade concurrently
  need to test verification code changes
  need to run parallel RAP simultaneously - HRRRv2 cannot run without RAPv3 running
  30-day evaluation will be required
  suggested evaluators - AWC,SPC,WPC, all NWS Regions, FAA

Dissemination info
  output should be placed into /com2/hrrr/para, /pcom2/para, and /com/nawips/para
  output should be placed on ftp server
  request that all gempak output be transferred to DEVWCOSS as well as all wrfsfc files
  code is proprietary, and restricted data is used but is not disseminated
