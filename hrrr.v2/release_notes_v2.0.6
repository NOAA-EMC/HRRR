pre-implementation testing requirements
    Please test as part of a production parallel test.   If that can't be accomplished, only a single HRRR cycle needs to be run, and only the forecast, post, wrfbufr, and sndp jobs need to be run.

    This implementation will occur simultaneously with station list implementations for the NAM, RAP, SREF, and HI-RES WINDOWS.
