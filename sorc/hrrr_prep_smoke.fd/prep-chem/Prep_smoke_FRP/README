Third Party Software Requirements
---------------------------------


 1. ZLIB 1.2.5(libz.a) or later  distribution.  You may download the software
    from the http://www.zlib.net/ site.
    
 2. HDF5-1.8.8(libhdf5_fortran.a, libhdf5hl_fortran.a) or later  distribution.  You may download the software
    from http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/obtain5.html.

    from http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf/netcdf-4_0_1/index.jsp
    

Configuring/Installing HDF 5
------------------------------

When compiling PREP-CHEM-SRC codes on a Linux system using the PGI (Intel)
compiler, make sure the netCDF and HDF* library has been installed using the same PGI (Intel) compiler.

FC=pgf90 CC=pgcc CXX=pgc++ ./configure  \
	--prefix=/path_libs/hdf5-1.8.8 \
	--with-zlib=/path_libs/zlib-1.2.5  \
	--disable-shared \
	--enable-fortran

make
make check
make install
make check-install


INSTALL ZLIB

FC=pgf90 CC=pgcc ./configure --prefix=/path-zlib-1.2.5

make
make check
make install

INSTALL NETCDF

FC=pgf90 CC=pgcc CXX=pgc++ ./configure --prefix=/path-netcdf-4.1.1

make
make check
make install

Configuring/Installing PREP-CHEM-SRC 
------------------------------

Copy files from extra/UserData to your user_data_dir sets into prep_chem_src.inp

cd bin/build
make OPT=opt.pgi CHEM=RACM

Using PREP-CHEM-SRC-1.4 with WRF-Chem V3.4.1
------------------------------

For additional information please consult the WRF-Chem Version 3.4 User's Guide, available at:
http://ruc.noaa.gov/wrf/WG11/Users_guide.pdf

PREP-CHEM-SRC-1.4 partitions anthropogenic and biomass burning NOx emissions into NO and NO2 as follows:

Anthropogenic (EDGAR, RETRO):
NO=0.7*NOx, NO2=0.3*NOx (by mass)
Biomass burning (3BEM, GFEDv2)
NO=0.4*NOx, NO2=0.6*NOx (by mass)

These ratios are based on tests for South America, and you may want to modify them depending on your local emissions profile.

(1) Compiling PREP-CHEM-SRC-1.4 for WRF-Chem (RADM/GOCART speciation)

cd bin/build

make OPT=gfortran.wrf CHEM=RADM_WRF_FIM
or
make OPT=intel.wrf CHEM=RADM_WRF_FIM
or
make OPT=pgi.wrf CHEM=RADM_WRF_FIM


(2) Running PREP-CHEM-SRC-1.4

Edit the input file: prep_chem_sources.inp. The following options should correspond to the Lambert map projection settings in namelist.wps: NINEST=i_parent_start, NJNEST=j_parent_start, POLELAT=ref_lat, POLELON=ref_lon, STDLAT1=truelat1 and STDLAT2=truelat2. CENTLAT and CENTLON are not used for WRF.
Run PREP-CHEM-SRC-1.4 for each day to produce the anthropogenic+biogenic (-ab.bin), biomass burning (-bb.bin), and optional GOCART (-gocartBG.bin) emissions:
./prep_chem_sources_RADM_WRF_FIM.exe

(3) Convert emissions for use in WRF-Chem

For WRFV3.3 only:
The standard WRFV3.3 release reads RADM emissions of only NO, not NO2, and will not work as-is with PREP-CHEM-SRC-1.4. To use PREP-CHEM-SRC-1.4 emissions in WRF-Chem V3.3, please do the following:
(a.1) Place the included files (./extra/WRFChemNO2) into the WRFV3.3/chem directory: module_plumerise1.F, module_add_emiss_burn.F, convert_emiss.F. Also, place the included registry.chem into the Registry directory. 
(a.2) For WRFV3.4.1 don't need copy WRFChemNO2 folder.

(b) In the WRFV3.4.1 directory, compile WRF-Chem and convert_emiss.exe:
./compile em_real
./compile emi_conv

For each day ($year-$mo-$day-00): 
Run real.exe with chem_opt=0 and start and end time set to $year-$mo-$day-00 to generate a wrfinput_d01 file with timestamp for that day.
./real.exe

Link PREP-CHEM-SRC-1.4 emissions to WRF run directory:
ln -sf PREP-CHEM-SRC-1.4/bin/WRF-$year-$mo-$day-000000-g1-gocartBG.bin wrf_gocart_backg
ln -sf PREP-CHEM-SRC-1.4/bin/WRF-$year-$mo-$day-000000-g1-ab.bin emissopt3_d01
ln -sf PREP-CHEM-SRC-1.4/bin/WRF-$year-$mo-$day-000000-g1-bb.bin emissfire_d01

Run convert_emiss:
../chem/convert_emiss.exe

Rename output to include the date:
wrfchemi_d01 wrfchemi_d01_{$year}-$mo-${da}_00:00:00
mv wrffirechemi_d01 wrffirechemi_d01_{$year}-$mo-${da}_00:00:00
mv wrfchemi_gocart_bg_d01 wrfchemi_gocart_bg_d01_{$year}-$mo-${da}_00:00:00

To generate emissions for more than one domain, repeat the above steps for each domain as if it were domain 1 (eg., change nx, ny, dx, dy in the d01 column in namelist.input to those for the subdomain), and rename the output files to include the domain number:
mv wrfchemi_d01 wrfchemi_d<domain>_{$year}-$mo-${da}_00:00:00
mv wrffirechemi_d01 wrffirechemi_d<domain>_{$year}-$mo-${da}_00:00:00
mv wrfchemi_gocart_bg_d01 wrfchemi_gocart_bg_d<domain>_{$year}-$mo-${da}_00:00:00

(4) Running WRF-Chem
Run real.exe to generate wrfinput_d<domain> and wrfbdy_d01 with chemistry.

First, double-check your namelist settings:

&time_control
 io_form_auxinput5                    = 2
 io_form_auxinput7                    = 2

 auxinput8_interval_m                = 1440,1440
 frames_per_auxinput7                = 1,1
