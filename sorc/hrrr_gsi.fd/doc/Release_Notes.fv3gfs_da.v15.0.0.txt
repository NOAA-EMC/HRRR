FV3GFS DA RELEASE NOTES (v15.0.0)

GIT TAG 
   * The FV3GFS DA is in NOAA VLAB gerrit:ProdGSI.  The FV3GFS DA tag is intended to be installed
     as part of the entire FV3GFS package.   Please see FV3GFS release notes for name and location 
     of FV3GFS tag in NOAA VLAB gerrit.   The FV3GFS tag contains a checkout script which checks out
     the appropriate FV3GFS DA tag.




DOC CHANGES 
   * Combine Release_Notes.gdas_da.v14.1.0.txt, Release_Notes.gfs_da.v14.1.0.txt, and 
     Release_Notes.global_shared_da.v14.1.0.txt into this document.  Update for FV3GFS DA component of 
     FV3GFS package.




CODE CHANGES
   * Data assimilation changes (global_gsi.x and global_enkf.x)
      * Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) moisture channels
      * Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) all-sky radiances 
      * A fix for an issue with the Near Sea Surface Temperature (NSST) in the Florida Strait
      * An upgrade to the use of Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) radiances
      * Addition of NOAA-20 CrIS and ATMS data 
      * Addition of Megha-Tropiques SAPHIR data
      * Addition of Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) data from MetOp-B
      * The analysis and the ensemble will increase in horizontal resolution from 35 km to 25 km.
      * The analysis nemsio file contains layer pressure (dpres) and layer height (delz), whose analysis increments 
        are computed hydrostatically from the temperature and surface pressure increments.
      * The analysis nemsio file contains cloud liquid water (clwmr) and cloud ice (icmr), partitioned from the 
        total cloud condensate analysis.
      * The analysis nemsio file contains vertical velocity (dzdt), rain (rwmr), snow (snmr), and graupel (grle), 
        which are copies of the background fields.
   * New FV3GFS DA code
      * calc_increment_ens.fd - compute analysis increment used to warm start FV3GFS model



JOB CHANGES
   * Update jobs to run within FV3GFS workflow
   * JGDAS_ANALYSIS_HIGH and JGFS_ANALYSIS have been merged into a single job, JGLOBAL_ANALYSIS.   
     Job JGLOBAL_ANALYSIS runs in both the GFS and GDAS cycle.
   * The following jobs have been renamed
      * JGDAS_ENKF_SELECT_OBS       --> JGLOBAL_ENKF_SELECT_OBS
      * JGDAS_ENKF_INNOVATE_OBS     --> JGLOBAL_ENKF_INNOVATE_OBS
      * JGDAS_ENKF_UPDATE           --> JGLOBAL_ENKF_UPDATE
      * JGDAS_ENKF_INFLATE_RECENTER --> JGDAS_ENKF_RECENTER
   * Neither the merging of GFS and GDAS analysis jobs into one nor the renaming of the GDAS EnKF jobs 
     changes workflow dependencies.



SCRIPT CHANGES
   * Update scripts to run within FV3GFS workflow.
   * The string "fv3gfs" has been added to the name of FV3GFS DA scripts to distinguish them from their non-FV3GFS 
     counterparts.   For example, exglobal_analysis.sh.ecf is renamed exglobal_analysis_fv3gfs.sh.ecf in the 
     FV3GFS package.  Below is a mapping between current operational GFS DA scripts and their FV3GFS DA 
     counterparts
      * exglobal_analysis.sh.ecf              --> exglobal_analysis_fv3gfs.sh.ecf
      * exglobal_enkf_innovate_obs.sh.ecf     --> exglobal_innovate_obs_fv3gfs.sh.ecf
      * exglobal_enkf_update.sh.ecf           --> exglobal_enkf_update_fv3gfs.sh.ecf
      * exglobal_enkf_inflate_recenter.sh.ecf --> exglobal_enkf_recenter_fv3gfs.sh.ecf
      * exglobal_enkf_fcst_nems.sh.ecf        --> exglobal_enkf_fcst_fv3gfs.sh.ecf
      * exglobal_enkf_post.sh.ecf             --> eexglobal_enkf_post_fv3gfs.sh.ecf
   * Add new script:  exglobal_enkf_innovate_obs_fv3gfs.sh.ecf.   This script is executed from 
     JGLOBAL_ENKF_INNOVATE_OBS.   It is a wrapper script that invokes exglobal_innovate_obs_fv3gfs.sh.ecf 
     for each ensemble member in the group processed by the given realization of JGLOBAL_ENKF_INNOVATE_OBS 



PARM CHANGES
   * Update to run within FV3GFS workflow.   Parm or configuration files for FV3GFS components now reside in 
     parm/config.   Below are the parm (config) files used by each FV3GFS DA job
      * JGLOBAL_ANALYSIS - config.base, config.anal
      * JGLOBAL_ENKF_SELECT_OBS - config.base, config.anal, config.eobs
      * JGLOBAL_ENKF_INNOVATE_OBS - config.base, config.anal, config.eobs
      * JGLOBAL_ENKF_UPDATE - config.base, config.anal, config.eupd
      * JGDAS_ENKF_RECENTER - config.base, config.ecen
      * JGDAS_ENKF_FCST - config.base, config.fcst, config.efcs
      * JGDAS_ENKF_POST - config.base, config.epos
   Parameters common to all jobs are in config.base.   Analysis jobs share config.anal.   This avoids 
   duplication of identical parameters across multiple parameter files.

            * gfs.t${cyc}z.atminc.nc - NetCDF file containing analysis increments.  The FV3GFS model 
              uses this file to warmstart the forecast model.
         * Remove
            * Relocation is no longer run.  Therefore, remove gdas.t${cyc}z.atm[gm2, gm1, gp1, gp2].nemsio

IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS
   * Please note that the DA components must be installed in conjunction with the entire FV3GFS package.  
     Thus, the implementation instructions below extract the entire FV3GFS package.   The FV3GFS package is 
     tagged in NOAA VLAB gerrit:fv3gfs as tag q2fy19_nco.   Implementation instructions for this tag follow
     below:

      1) cd  $NWROOTp3

      2) mkdir $NWROOTp3/gfs.v15.0.0

      3) cd $NWROOTp3/gfs.v15.0.0

      4) git clone --recursive gerrit:fv3gfs .
         * Notes:
            * The "." after fv3gfs is important.  It tells git to clone fv3gfs into the local working directory, 
              $NWROOTp3/gfs.v15.0.0.
            * The SPA(s) handling the FV3GFS implementation may encounter "permission denied" messages when 
             attempting to clone Vlab gerrit repositories.  Code managers need to add the SPA(s) as project 
             developers.  For the fv3gfs project please contact Fanglin.Yang@noaa.gov or Mark.Potts@noaa.gov.  
             For the FV3GFS DA project please contact Michael.Lueken@noaa.gov or Mark.Potts@noaa.gov. 

      5) git checkout q2fy19nco

      6) cd sorc

      7) ./checkout.sh
         * This script extracts the following FV3GFS components from gerrit:  FV3GFS model, FV3GFS DA, 
           FV3GFS UPP, FV3GFS WAFS

      8) ./build_all.sh
         * Script build_all.sh compiles all FV3GFS components.   Runtime output from the build for each 
           package is written to log files in directory logs.  Specifically, FV3GFS DA build information 
           is written to logs/build_gsi.log.  Script build_gsi.sh invokes gsi.fd/ush/build_all_cmke.sh.
           This script uses cmake to build FV3GFS DA components.   Script build_all_cmake.sh accepts two 
           command line options:  build type and directory path to package.  Two build types are 
           supported - PRODUCTION (default) and DEBUG.

      9) ./link_fv3gfs.sh nco dell



JOB DEPENDENCIES & FLOW DIAGRAM
   * No change in FV3GFS DA job dependencies with respect to current operations
