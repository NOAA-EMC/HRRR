This directory contains the latex source for creating the enkf user's guide. This document requires
an instillation of latex that supports the CTAN extensions. 

1. Required flavor of LaTex.
Options for the three main platforms.

Windows:
The most popular choice here is the MiKTEX (http://www.miktex.org) distribution, which lets you easily 
manage TEX packages. Many people advise beginners to get the proTEXt bundling of MiKTEX, which lets you 
install by using a .pdf file with links so you can read about your options and then click on the right 
one. And it includes other components that help you work with your TEX system.

Unix-type systems, including GNU/Linux:
The best choice here is TEX Live (http://tug.org/texlive/), which contains many packages and programs. 
It is freely available over the Internet or on disc; see the web page for details. Note that most Unix 
systems have TEX as an installation option so you might already have it or be able to easily get it using 
your system administration package management tool: RPM, or DEB, or whatever.

Mac­in­tosh:
Get the MacTEX (http://tug.org/mactex/) distribution, which is TEX Live with some Mac specific goodies.

2. Building the user's guide document. 
Run LaTex on the file main.tex. It imports organizes each of the individual chapter files. This creates 
the document main.pdf.
