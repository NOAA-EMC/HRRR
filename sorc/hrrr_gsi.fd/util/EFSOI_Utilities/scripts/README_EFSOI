README file instructions for EFSOI calculations on the Theia
machines (04/12/2017).

# Overview of EFSOI functionality  #
####################################
The inputs required for EFSOI calculations are prepared 
via the scripts in this directory (i.e util/EFSOI_utilities).
Note that these scripts in turn use ancillary scripts 
to perform the ensemble of forecasts needed for EFSOI. 
Special instructions to setup the scripts from the
sandbox project are provided by instruction
(2) below.

# Instructions for performing EFSOI calculations #
##################################################
1) Run a 3DEnVar, 4DEnVar or pure EnKF GFS experiment.  When doing this 
   make sure to set fso_cycling to .true. in the exglobal_enkf_update.sh.ecf 
   script, and set $ARCHIVE_ENSEMBLE to YES in your para config file to output 
   EnKF products (FG files) necessary for the EFSOI calculations.  Modify your 
   rlist file to add archival of files with the naming convention sanl_${CDATE}_nimemxxx 
   (where xxx refers to the ensemble member number) and osense_${CDATE}.dat.  
   The additional sanl* files correspond to the direct result of the EnKF update, 
   and represent a non-inflated set of EnKF analyses.  If you do not see
   archival of both the osense_${CDATE}.dat and sanl_${CDATE}_nimemxxx
   files, something has gone wrong, in this case please contact David Groff
   (david.groff@noaa.gov) as necessary.
2) Instructions relating to sandbox scripts that
   perform the necessary forecasts:

   # sandbox scripts                                                     #
   # !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!#
   -  Create the following directory from your home directory.
      $HOME/svn-work/GDAS
   -  cd to the newly created $HOME/svn-work/GDAS directory.
   -  Perform a checkout of the relevant scripts as follows:
      svn checkout -r60977 https://svnemc.ncep.noaa.gov:/projects/sandbox/Rahul.Mahajan/trunk/GDAS/scripts
   -  Modify param_EFSO.j and advance_ensemble.j as necessary.
      To see an example for the changes needed to make the scripts functional,
      compare param_EFSO.j and advance_ensemble.j from
      /scratch4/NCEPDEV/da/save/David.Groff/EFSOI/shared_scripts
      with param_template.j and advance_ensemble.j in your checkout
      of the relevant scripts.
      ---List of changes for param_template.j ---
      i)    Comment out start_date and end_date
      ii)   Set PSLOT and ROTDIR
      iii)  Set FHOUT to 6 (i.e 6 hour output forecast intervals)
      iv)   Set FHMAX to 30 (i.e each cycle we need 30 hour forecasts)
      v)    Set FHCYC to 30.
      vi)   Set FHDFI and FHDFI_ENKF to 0.
      vii)  Turn off stochastic physics, set sppt, shum, skeb and vcamp to zero.
      viii) Set BASEGFS to the directory relevant to the global_fcst version of your choice.
      ix)   Set HOMEDIR, PTMP to directories with adequate disk space (etc.).
      ---List of changes for advance_ensemble.j ---
      i)    All instances of setting SUFOUT need to be with the following conventions:
            setenv SUFOUT _nimem.
      ii)   Add  the following to the top of the script.
            set end_date   = $2 
            set begin_date = $2    
   -  Copy over job_monitor.py and advance_time from Dave Groff's
      $HOME/bin to your $HOME/bin.
   # --------------------------------------------------------------------#
3) Go to /scripts/EnKF/scripts_ncep from the root 
   of your working copy branch and perform the
   following modifications to scripts in this
   directory:
   
   efso_file_assembly.sh: 
   i.   Set the SCRIPTS_DIR directory
        to the /util/EFSO_utilities/scripts directory from
        the root of your working copy branch.
   ii.  Set WDIR to a directory you have permissions to, 
        that provides adequate disk space (etc.) for
        the required inputs for the EFSOI calculation
        (eg. stmp4 on Theia).       
   iii. Under the documentation title "Parallel experiment context"
        modify $HSI_DIR and $HFILE1 throug $HFILE7 to refer to 
        the directories where you are archiving EnKF products 
        from your parallel experiments.  Note that the appropriate 
        dates get handled by the wrapper script, so just modify 
        the bits that do not relate to the date.
     
   efso_advance_ensemble.sh:
   i.   Change $WDIR to be consistent with $WDIR in your efso_file_assembly.sh (eg. stmp4 (etc.)).
   ii.  Change $ADVANCE_CURRENT_RUNDIR and $ADVANCE_PREVIOUS_RUNDIR to be
        consistent with that specified in the script changes you performed to
        the sandbox scripts in step (2).  When doing this do not modify
        the $PYMDH and $YMDH directory extension (the dates) that are currently 
        in the version you checked out (i.e the last directory in the path already 
        specified in the script you checked out).
   iii. Set $ADVANCE_CURRENT_ROTDIR and $ADVANCE_PREVIOUS_ROTDIR to the directory
        specified as ROTDIR in the param_EFSOI.j script you modified from step (2).
        Again leave (do not delete) the $YMDH and $PYMDH already in the version 
        you checked out.
   iv.  You can generate your own version of getsigensmeanp_smooth.x, or for now
        simply leave $EXEC_ENKF_STATS as it is versioned now (no changes necessary).
   v.   Modify the paths specified by the *ENSMEAN* variables to be consistent with
        your $WDIR directory as you specified in efso_file_assembly.sh.
   vi.  Modify the paths specified by the *MEMBER* variables to be consistent with
        your *ROTDIR* locations.

   efso_run.sh:
   i.   Modify $WDIR to be consistent with what you specified in efso_file_assembly.sh.
   ii.  Set $FIXDIR to the fix directory of your branch.
   iii. Set $EFSOI_OUTPUT_DIR to a directory where you would like to accumulate EFSOI stats.
   iv.  Set $SCRIPTS_DIR to the /util/EFSOI_utilities/scripts from the root
        of your branch.
   v.   Modify your specified account (eg. da-cpu) for submission as necessary.

4) Execute the efso wrapper script from the command line to
   perform EFSOI calculations for a period of time: 
./efso_wrapper.sh Begin_Date Experiment_Name End_Date
(example) ./efso_wrapper.sh 2015120100 prfsoidjf 2015121000
