README rwMon package

The rwMon (radial wind monitoring) package can be used to identify which radars
do or do not have radial wind observations or are missing from the bufr file
completely. The package has only been run on Theia.

The package is organized into three main files. The first, run_monitor.ksh takes
two user inputs: ANALFILE and STDOUT. ANALFILE can be any nemsio file, this doesn't
really matter because it is only used to help make the plot. STDOUT is the standard
output file generated by the GSI. The package parses through the STDOUT file for
all the radars that are listed in the "master list" and stores it in an array to be
compared with the stations in radar_list. A red star is plotted for stations that 
have zero observations but was present in the "master list", a green star is plotted
for stations with 1 or more observations, and a black star is plotted for stations
that do not occur in the "master list". Although station may not appear in the
"master list" doesn't mean they have zero observations. This may be because of 
data latency or quality control. The second is plot_radar.py, which is run by the
run script which provides the necessary variables and arrays to generate the plot.

To run:
Provide run_monitor.ksh with the USER INPUT. A sample STDOUT file is provided in
./sample_input/stdout. Then run the script. A figure will be generated in it's
corresponding analysis time directory.
