This utility will convert a GFS-GSI compatible background error fixed
   file from the old "assumed" format to the new, generalized control
   variable format.  This is especially useful since the NMC-stats
   code does not output the new format (yet).

To compile:
   xlf90 convert2gcv.f -o convert.x /nwprod/lib/libbacio_4.a

The program will then expect to read in a file of the old format with 
   the name "berror_stats_in1".  The utility will figure out the proper
   dimensions of the file from the header information, and output a new
   file in the "gcv" format of the name "berror_stats_genvar".

The utility can only handle files with the following number of latitude
   points (since it also adds corresponding longitude information to the
   new file format):
   
   nlat=882  ; nlat=578  ; nlat=386 ; nlat=290 ; nlat=258 ; nlat=192 ; nlat=130 ; nlat=96

   These values correspond to the commonly used Gaussian grids with the GFS-GSI.
