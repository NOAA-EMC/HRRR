The RadMon package can be configured for your particular data source by 
modifying the RadMon_user_settings script in this directory, or by overriding
specific entries in that script within your interactive shell.  

Similarly package configuration changes can be made by modifying individual 
values in the RadMon_config script in this directory, or by overriding 
specific entries in that script within your interactive shell.

If you have not done so already, please run the RadMon_install.sh script 
located in the directory one level from here.  RadMon_install.sh will update 
the RadMon_config and RadMon_user_settings files and set some defaults based 
on the system you're running on (wcoss or theia). It will also run the makeall.sh 
script which will build all the necessary executables and move them to the 
appropriate exec directories within the package.

Next, edit or override specific values in the RadMon_user_settings script as
necessary.  For example, the default $RADSTAT_LOCATION, or directory which
contains the *.radstat files you want to process, is set by default to 
/com2/gfs/prod.  You may edit this location in the file to anything you want 
or set a value for $RADSTAT_LOCATION in your shell.  The values of any 
variables in RadMon_user_settings will be overriden by the same variables 
declared in your interactive shell.  To override the RADSTAT_LOCATION the
the command is generally:

> export RADSTAT_LOCATION=/my/directory/not/the/default

Depending on which interactive shell you are using the command might be 
slightly different.  The above example works on csh and bash.

If you are working from a centrally installed RadMon package supporting 
multiple users you will probably want to define $MY_TANKDIR to someplace in your 
local filespace.

If you want to swap in your own copy of either the RadMon_config or 
RadMon_user_settings files you can similarly declare that within your 
shell:

> export RADMON_CONFIG=/my/directory/not/the/default/my_radmon_config
> export RADMON_USER_SETTINGS=/my/directory/not/the/default/my_radmon_user_settings
