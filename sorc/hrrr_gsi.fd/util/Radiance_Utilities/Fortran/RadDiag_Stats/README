Programs to produce netCDF files containing stats for a time-range of 
diag files.
-----------------------------

Main programs:

Compute_RadDiag_Stats.f90:  Computes statistics for a set of diag files for a 
            given instrument and outputs to a netCDF file.  Stats are 
            calculated for each channel including timeseries and as a 
            function of scan position.
            Compile with "make"

Compute_RadDiag_Stats_2D.f90: Computes maps of radiance statistics for a given
           instrument.   Compile with make -f Makefile_2D



netCDF output from these routines can be read with the IDL routines in 
util/Radiance_Utilities/IDL/RadDiag_Stats
