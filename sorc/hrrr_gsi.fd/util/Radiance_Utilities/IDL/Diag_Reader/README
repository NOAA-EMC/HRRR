Procedures to read diag files directly into IDL structures and to calculate
stats.
===========================================================

N.B. Some of these routines require the procedures colour_setup.pro and 
set_filled_circle.pro.  These can be found in the GSI repository in the 
util/Radiance_Utilities/IDL/Misc directory.

===========================================================

read_diags.pro:  Procedure to radiance diag files into IDL structures.
                 Usage:
                 read_diags,file,obsdata,metadata,nobs,nchan,verbose=verbose,$
                    Old_Version=Old_Version,ChanInfo=ChanInfo,Swap_Endian=Swap_Endian
                 (verbose, Old_Version, ChanInfo and Swap_Endian are optional arguments)
                 obsdata, metadata and ChanInfo are structures.  
                 Use help,/struct,obsdata  etc. to examine contents.
                 Examples:
                 1) To plot all obsvalues for channel 1 type:
                     plot,obs(*).obs(0)   (IDL indicies start at 0)
                 2) To plot the bias-corrected departure for the 3rd spectrum:
                     plot,obs(2).depar_bc(*)

diag_stats.pro:  Calculates simple statstics using structures produced by
                 read_diags.pro

Plot_Observation_Summary.pro:
                 Reads in observations from a specified list of instruments and
                 times and produces summary plots for each instrument as a 
                 function of channel.  
                 The program should be modified as required by editing the 
                 section above the dashed lines.
                 The program is run (inside IDL) by typing 
                 .rnew Plot_Observation_Summary
                 By default, output is to the screen.  This can be changed to
                 postscript by typing set_plot,'PS' at the IDL prompt before 
                 running.
                 This program requires the colour_setup
                 and set_filled_circle procedures which are found in the
                 ../Misc directory.

Plot_Histogram_2d_ScanAngle.pro:
                 Reads in a series of diag files and produces 2D histograms for
                 a specified range of channels.  This program uses the Coyote
                 IDL library obtainable from 
                 http://www.dfanning.com/documents/programs.html 

read_conv.pro:   Like read_diags.pro but for conventional data.  Still being 
                 developed - use at own risk!
