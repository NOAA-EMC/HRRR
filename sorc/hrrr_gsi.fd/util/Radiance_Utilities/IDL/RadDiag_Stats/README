IDL Routines for Plotting NetCDF files produced by RadDiag_Stats package.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

RadDiag_Stats files are produced by code found at 
util/Radiance_Utilities/Fortran/RadDiag_Stats

Some of these routines have just been copied across from CRTM and are not yet 
documented here.

**** Some routines use the Coyote IDL library - available at ****
**** http://www.dfanning.com/documents/programs.html         ****

Main reading routine:

read_netcdf.pro:   Reads any netCDF file and outputs the result to a structure.
                   Typical calling sequence is a=read_netcdf(file,data) where
                   file is the file to be read, data contains the structure
                   a is the output status. 
                   This uses the functions contain in is_netcdf.pro and 
                   valid_string.pro in this directory.


General Plotting Routines:

Plot_Observation_Summary_NetCDF.pro:  Plots summary of first-guess and analysis
                              departures for a number of specified instruments.
                              x-axis for these plots is channel number.
Plot_RadDiag_2D_netCDF.pro:   Plots 2D maps of radiance statistics
Plot_ScanDep_NetCDF.pro:      Plot scan-dependent departure statistics.

All of the above are IDL programs which are run with the .rnew directive. Users
edit the part of the program file above the dotted line to control what is read
in and plotted.
These programs require the colour_setup.pro file found in 
util/Radiance_Utilities/IDL/Misc
