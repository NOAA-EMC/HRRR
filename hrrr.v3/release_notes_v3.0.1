* Repository Details
   * After cloning the hrrr.v3.0.1 branch of the EMC_hrrr git repository using the command below, retrieve the new code from the hrrr.v3 directory.
      *  git clone -b hrrr.v3.0.1 ssh://${USER}@vlab.ncep.noaa.gov:29418/EMC_hrrr hrrr.v3.0.1
   * The build script is located here: hrrr.v3.0.1/hrrr.v3/sorc/build_hrrr_all.scr
   * Note that the build scripts have been updated from v3.0.0 to comply with EE2 standards.  To build the code, run build_hrrr_all.sh and specify which codes you would like compiled within the script ("yes" or "no" switches).
