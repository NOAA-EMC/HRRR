Release Notes: HRRR v4.1.12

v4.1.12 - released December 11, 2023
* Script changes to add DBN alerts for archiving the 36-member, 1-hour HRRRDAS forecasts and 1-hr HRRR CONUS forecasts valid at 00, 03, 06, 09, 12, 15, 18, and 21Z to NOMADS.  
   * The Warn on Forecast System (WoFS) needs these files put on NOMADS to support their efforts.  A 24-hour retention period on NOMADS is sufficient.


* Repository Details
   * Clone the hrrr.v4.1.12 branch of the HRRR GitHub repository using the following command (contains v4.1.12 release notes):

* script files changed
   * scripts/conus/exhrrr_post.sh
   * scripts/hrrrdas/exhrrr_fcst.sh

* resource changes
   * These changes result in saving an additional ~261 GB of data to NOMADS for every third cycle (02, 05, 08, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23Z), and ~2.08 TB of data per day.

   * Run the forecast job for a single cycle for HRRRDAS, and the f01 post job for a single cycle for HRRR CONUS.  Choose from either the 02, 05, 08, 11, 14, 17, 20, or 23Z cycles.  A full cycle test is not needed.
   * Note: I have never added DBN alerts to an operational package before, so please refer to lines 485-490 of scripts/hrrrdas/exhrrr_fcst.sh to see my changes for the HRRRDAS files.  I copied a DBN alert from the HRRR CONUS but was not sure what identifier to put after "MODEL".
